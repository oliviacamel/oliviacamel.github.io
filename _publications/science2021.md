excerpt: 'Significance: Mammalian DNA replication follows a highly regulated programme, known as the DNA replication timing (RT) programme that is evolutionarily conserved and correlated with chromatin features such as histone modifications and the three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture. However, its functional significance had been elusive since its discovery. Here, we show that increased replication stochasticity in the cell population leads to genome-wide aberrations of chromatin modifications and the reorgniasation of 3D chromatin compartmentalisation. These findings establish the first mechanistic link showing the RT programme acts upstream of and is causal for the propagation of epigenetic memory.

The temporal order of DNA replication [replication timing (RT)] is correlated with chromatin modifications and three-dimensional genome architecture; however, causal links have not been established, largely because of an inability to manipulate the global RT program. We show that loss of RIF1 causes near-complete elimination of the RT program by increasing heterogeneity between individual cells. RT changes are coupled with widespread alterations in chromatin modifications and genome compartmentalization. Conditional depletion of RIF1 causes replication-dependent disruption of histone modifications and alterations in genome architecture. These effects were magnified with successive cycles of altered RT. These results support models in which the timing of chromatin replication and thus assembly plays a key role in maintaining the global epigenetic state.
